# PathFindAlg-pygame
I create a simple path finding algorithm for a grid of numbers. I utilize pygame in order to make it more interactive. 

The file "AISubscript.py" contains a cmd line version of the pathfinding "algorithm". It records the best possible route with steps and writes it into the "PathZ.txt" file. From there, the "game.py" code contains all the pygame mechanics and reads the files contents and displays it onto pygame.
Currently, it only utilizes randomizations (brute force) in order to find the best path, and so can not be considered a "true" path finding algorithm.
